Assignment:Lab 4-A -Hash Table, word Embeddings
Last Modification: 11/11/2018
Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to practice and note the
difference in computation times of insertion and retrieval froma  Hash Table,
we aree provided with a word embeding file and are required to insert each 
word and its embeding vector into a table. After the insertions we must 
retrieved words based on pairs read from another file and compute the similarity.
during the search operation we will compute average comparisons per search.
